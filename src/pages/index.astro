			<p>Apprendo is a free learning app designed to support BRIDGEGOOD UX apprentices and empower creatives of color in the tech and design fields.</p>
			<p>Over 4 weeks, I completed this case study as part of Googleâ€™s Tech Equity Collective, using Googleâ€™s Design Sprint methodology to research, prototype, and validate solutions that address barriers faced by underrepresented creatives.</p>
			<p>Using tools such as Figma, Miro, Slack, Discord, and Google Workspace, I strengthened my skills in project leadership, collaboration, and end-to-end UX design while learning how to guide a team toward building impactful, equity-driven solutions.</p>
